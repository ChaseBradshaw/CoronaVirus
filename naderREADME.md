- Found a good API resource from the New York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data),
however, we decided to go with Web Scraping from Worldometers.com to allow for more flexibility
- We may still impliment this if we deciede to get more specific data than State wide
- Bryce and I will be working on the database to hold user emails & COVID-19 stats
